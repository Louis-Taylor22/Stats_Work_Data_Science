# Stats_Work_Data_Science
Work created whilst learning inferential statistics during my data science module

30th January 2023 - Introduction to Stats! :) 
In today's session, I set up a new project and loaded the data made by Darwin which investigated whether self or cross fertilised plants have different height advntages/disadvantages. The data was then visualised and tidied before the mean and the mean difference between self and cross plants was calculated. Confidence intervals were then calculated.
